# EDSL - Element DSL

This gem implements an extensible DSL for declaring web elements as part of a page object pattern.  The focus of this gem is making it easy add new accessors allowing for more flexibility when creating abstractions.

This gem does not implement the page object pattern, for an implementation of page object using this gem see edsl-pageobject.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'edsl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install edsl

## Usage

Below is an example of how one might extend the DSL to add a new type of element.
 
```ruby
class DateEdit < SimpleDelegatopr
  def value
    Chronic.parse(super)
  end
end

opts = { how: :text_field,           # call text_field to find this type of element
		 assign_method: :set,        # call element.set(value) when we call name=
		 default_method: :value,     # call element.value when we call name
		 presence_method: :present?
		 wrapper_fn: lambda { |ele, _parent| DateEdit.new(ele) }
		 } # call element.present? when we call name?

EDSL.define_accessor(:date_field, opts )
```
